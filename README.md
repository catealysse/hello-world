I'm a Psychology graduate with minors in both Writing and Cognitive Science. I have an undeniable passion for the innerworkings of the mind, but equally love the written language and using media to spread meaningful content to the world. With my most recent venture into learning Visual Design, I'm exploring my creative side and hoping to become a multifaceted, well-rounded creative professional.
